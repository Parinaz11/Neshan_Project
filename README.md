# Neshan Project

This is the final project for my data science course. This project was assigned to us with the help of a Persian app called Neshan (similar to Google Maps) in which the user can get the shortest paths by giving their current location and destination.

In this project we were given a csv file conatining data with features such as weather, holiday, speed, etc and a graph containing the information for street lengths in a city. The goal was to train a model with which we can predict the shortest path possible from one location to another by having the info for those features.

Using preprocessing, dijkstra's algorithm for graphs and training with evaluation, we were able to achieve reasonable results.
